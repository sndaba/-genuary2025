## Infinite Scroll.</br>
An illusion of an infinite scroll as an art plot in R using ggplot2 and gganimate.</br>
This plot creates a repetitive pattern of lines that appear to scroll continuously.</br>
### How It Works:
Data Generation:    A sinusoidal wave is created for each "row" (y), and the group ensures they are treated as separate lines.</br></br>
Animation:           The transition_reveal(x) animates the lines, giving the illusion of continuous scrolling.</br></br>
Styling:             A black background with bright, vibrant colors creates a striking visual effect.
